# SearchEngine

This program lays the foundation of an autocomplete program run on a server. Whenever the user types in a word, the server gives a list of suggestions based off the frequency of the word with the prefix. The underlying datastructure is a trie.


To run the SearchEngine do the following

1. Clone the repository somewhere
2. Build the project (I did it in Netbeans with the build option)
3. CD into the base directory (wordsEn.txt should be there)
4. Run SearchEngine from the command line
5. Type in your search term


#Testing
There is a file named Testing.java that runs a series of tests

#TODO:
Create webpage to run the search engine
