# SearchEngine
To run the SearchEngine do the following

1. Clone the repository somewhere
2. Build the project (I did it in Netbeans with the build option)
3. CD into the base directory (wordsEn.txt should be there)
4. Run SearchEngine from the command line
5. Type in your search term


#Testing
There is a file named Testing.java that runs a series of tests

#TODO:
Create webpage to run the search engine
