Information about a motive in the shooting wasn't immediately available.
The shooting occurred about 9 p.m. local time at Sarona Market, an entertainment district crowded with locals and tourists in food stalls, restaurants and cafes. The market is across the street from Israel's defense ministry and main army headquarters.
The market area was cleared while officers searched for explosives, Rosenfeld said.
"Special patrol units are still working in the area to make sure there is no more danger," he said.
Rosenfeld said knife attacks have been more common lately, with the last shooting in Tel Aviv occurring months ago.
